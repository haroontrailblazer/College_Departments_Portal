# College Extension Application - User Manual

## Overview

The College Extension Application is a client-server system designed for educational institutions where multiple departments can securely connect to a central server, submit data, and export information for analysis. Each department has its own login credentials and can submit various types of data through a user-friendly Windows application.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- Python 3.7+ (for development) or use provided executables

### Quick Setup (Using Executables)
1. Extract the deployment package
2. Run `DatabaseSetup.exe` to initialize the database
3. Start `CollegeServer.exe` on the main server computer
4. Run `CollegeClient.exe` on each department computer

### Development Setup
1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   python setup_database.py
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
4. Launch client GUI:
   ```bash
   python client_gui.py
   ```

## Configuration

### Server Configuration
- **Default Port**: 9999
- **Database File**: college_data.db
- **Host**: localhost (modify for network deployment)
- **Connection Timeout**: 60 seconds (increased from 30 seconds)

### Network Deployment
For multi-computer deployment:
1. Install the server on a central computer
2. Configure Windows Firewall to allow port 9999
3. Update client applications with server IP address
4. Ensure network connectivity between all machines

## User Guide

### Auto-Connection Feature
The client application now automatically connects to the server on startup:
- **No Manual Connection Required**: The server connection section is hidden
- **Automatic Retry**: If connection fails, it automatically retries every 5 seconds
- **Immediate Data Entry**: Data entry fields are enabled as soon as connection is established
- **Seamless Experience**: Users can start entering data immediately after login

### For System Administrators

#### Initial Setup
1. **Database Initialization**:
   - Run the database setup script
   - Verify sample departments are created
   - Note the login credentials

2. **Server Deployment**:
   - Start the server application
   - Monitor connection logs
   - Ensure firewall settings allow connections

3. **Client Distribution**:
   - Install client applications on department computers
   - Configure server IP addresses
   - Test connections with sample credentials

#### User Management
- Department credentials are stored in the database
